# Code Story Generator - Next Steps & Roadmap

## Current State

✅ **Working MVP Features:**
- Git history parsing for individual files
- AI-powered narrative generation with pattern recognition
- Interactive deep-dive analysis with technical details
- Support for both Anthropic API and local LLMs (LM Studio)
- Clean CLI interface with verbose mode

**What Works Well:**
- Identifies patterns (features, refactors, bug fixes, etc.)
- Provides technical reasoning and design decisions
- Shows trade-offs and implementation details
- Fast with Claude API (~5 seconds for 90 commits)

**Current Limitations:**
- Single file analysis only
- No caching (re-parses every time)
- Can be shallow on complex architectural changes
- No way to export/save analyses
- No cross-file relationship tracking

## Immediate Next Steps (High Value, 1-2 weeks)

### 1. Real-World Testing & Validation

**Goal:** Understand where the tool fails or gives inadequate insights

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Test on 5-10 diverse repositories:
  - Different languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go)
  - Different team sizes (solo projects vs large OSS)
  - Different ages (new projects vs 5+ years old)
  - Different patterns (microservices, monoliths, libraries)
- [ ] Document specific failure modes:
  - Where narratives are too generic
  - When pattern detection misses important changes
  - Edge cases (merge commits, rebases, file renames)
- [ ] Create a "known issues" list
- [ ] Build test suite with example repos

**Success Metrics:**
- 80% of analyses provide actionable insights
- Can handle repos with 1000+ commits per file
- Accurately identifies at least 5 pattern types

### 2. Output Quality Refinement

**Goal:** Make analyses consistently deep and actionable

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Improve prompts for specific patterns:
  - Security fixes: "What vulnerability? How fixed? Impact?"
  - API changes: "Breaking changes? Migration path? Deprecations?"
  - Performance: "Bottleneck identified? Measurement? Gains?"
  - Migrations: "Why migrate? What changed? Rollback plan?"
- [ ] Add commit hash references in narratives:
  - Link specific decisions to actual commits
  - Enable "jump to code" workflow
  - Show commit graph relationships
- [ ] Include code snippets selectively:
  - Show critical before/after for key decisions
  - Highlight the "aha moment" in diffs
- [ ] Add confidence scores:
  - "High confidence: explicit performance fix"
  - "Medium confidence: appears to be refactoring"
  - "Low confidence: unclear motivation"

**Success Metrics:**
- Narratives include specific commit references
- 90% of deep dives include code examples
- Pattern detection has >85% accuracy

### 3. Caching System

**Goal:** Eliminate redundant git parsing and API calls

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Design cache schema:
  ```typescript
  {
    repoPath: string,
    filePath: string,
    lastCommitHash: string,
    parsedCommits: CommitInfo[],
    segments: StorySegment[],
    timestamp: Date
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement local cache (JSON files in ~/.code-story-cache/)
- [ ] Invalidation strategy:
  - Check if file has new commits
  - Only re-analyze new commits
  - Merge with existing segments intelligently
- [ ] Add `--no-cache` flag for force refresh
- [ ] Cache management commands:
  - `code-story cache clear`
  - `code-story cache list`
  - `code-story cache stats`

**Success Metrics:**
- 90% faster on second analysis of same file
- Cache hit rate > 70% in normal usage
- Automatic invalidation works correctly

## Medium-Term Enhancements (Makes It Essential, 1-2 months)

### 4. Cross-File Analysis ⭐ (Highest Impact)

**Goal:** Understand how changes propagate across codebase

**Features:**
- Detect related changes across files in same commit
- Build change dependency graph
- Show architectural evolution patterns
- Identify cascading refactors

**Example Output:**
```
Performance fix in parser.ts triggered:
├─ api.ts: Updated to use new parser interface
├─ tests/parser.test.ts: Added performance benchmarks
├─ utils/cache.ts: New caching layer to leverage speedup
└─ docs/performance.md: Documented 50x improvement
```

### 5. Export & Integration

**Features:**
- Save stories as markdown for documentation
- Git alias: `git story <file>`
- VS Code extension for in-editor analysis
- GitHub Action to auto-generate on PR
- Slack/Discord notifications for major changes

### 6. Smart Filtering & Search

**Features:**
- Query language: `pattern:performance author:alice date:2024`
- Saved searches/filters
- Trend analysis: "Performance improvements over time"
- Anomaly detection: "Unusual commit patterns"

---

## Long-Term Vision (3-6 months)

### 7. Team Intelligence
- Identify expert areas by commit patterns
- Onboarding guides auto-generated from history
- Knowledge transfer through code archaeology

### 8. Predictive Insights
- "Files likely to change together based on history"
- "This pattern usually leads to bugs - be careful"
- "Similar refactor in ProjectX can inform this change"

### 9. Multi-Repo Analysis
- Understand microservice evolution patterns
- Cross-repo dependency impact analysis
- Organization-wide architectural trends

## Immediate Action Plan (Next 2 Weeks)

**Week 1: Testing & Learning**
1. Set up test repository collection (5 diverse repos)
2. Run analysis on each, document results
3. Identify top 3 pain points
4. Refine prompts based on findings

**Week 2: Quick Wins**
1. Add commit hash references to narratives
2. Implement basic caching (even if simple)
3. Improve at least 2 pattern-specific prompts
4. Write usage documentation

**Decision Point (End Week 2):**
- Is cross-file analysis the right next big feature?
- Or should we focus on export/integration first?
- What did testing reveal as most critical need?

## How to Prioritize

**High Impact, Low Effort:**
- Commit hash references
- Better prompts for specific patterns
- Basic caching

**High Impact, High Effort:**
- Cross-file analysis
- VS Code extension
- Smart filtering

**Nice to Have:**
- Multiple output formats
- Custom pattern definitions
- Advanced visualization

**Ask These Questions:**
1. Does this make the tool 10x more useful?
2. Can it be done in <1 week?
3. Does it unlock other features?

If yes to 2 out of 3 → do it next.
