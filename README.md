**Give Claude Code long-term memory and project knowledge.**

Workshop is a production-ready context management system that gives Claude Code institutional memory. It automatically captures decisions, gotchas, and learnings from your conversations‚Äîand can even import months of past session history.

No manual note-taking. No context loss. Just continuous, persistent project knowledge.

---

## üéØ Why Workshop?

**The Problem**: Claude Code has amazing conversations but terrible memory. Every new session starts from scratch. Your architectural decisions, lessons learned, and project context vanish after each compaction.

**The Solution**: Workshop gives Claude persistent memory. It automatically:
- üìù **Records decisions** with reasoning as you discuss them
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documents gotchas** and constraints as you discover them
- üîÑ **Captures session summaries** when conversations end
- üß† **Answers "why" questions** by searching past decisions
- üì• **Imports historical sessions** to backfill months of knowledge
- üéØ **Tracks goals and blockers** across sessions

**Result**: Claude remembers everything about your project, even weeks or months later.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install claude-workshop

# Set up Claude Code integration (one-time)
workshop init

# Import your past sessions (optional but recommended)
workshop import --execute
```

That's it! Claude now has persistent memory in this project.

**In your next Claude Code session**, try:
```
"What decisions have we made about the database?"
"What gotchas should I know about?"
"What were we working on last session?"
```

Claude will search Workshop's knowledge base and give you context-aware answers.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Context Capture**
Claude automatically records important information as you work:
- Architectural decisions with reasoning
- Gotchas, constraints, and lessons learned
- Session summaries (what you worked on, files changed)
- User preferences and coding style
- Current goals and blockers

**You do nothing**‚Äîit just works.

### 2. **Historical Session Import** üî•
The game-changer: Import your existing Claude Code conversation history.

```bash
workshop import --execute
```

Workshop analyzes past sessions using pattern matching to extract:
- Decisions: "We decided to use PostgreSQL because..."
- Gotchas: "Watch out for the rate limit on this API..."
- Discoveries: "Turns out the cache needs to be invalidated..."
- Summaries: Complete session summaries from compactions

**This means Workshop can learn from conversations you had weeks or months ago**, giving Claude instant access to all your project's history.

### 3. **Smart Search & Context**
Claude can query Workshop to answer questions:

```bash
workshop why "using zustand"     # Why did we choose this?
workshop search "authentication"  # Find all auth-related entries
workshop context                  # Current project state
workshop sessions                 # Past session summaries
```

Full-text search powered by SQLite FTS5 makes everything instantly retrievable.

### 4. **Per-Project Memory**
Each project gets its own knowledge base:
- Per-project `.workshop/workshop.db` database
- Auto-configuration via `~/.workshop/config.json`
- Works seamlessly across project directories
- Optional web UI for browsing (`workshop web`)

### 5. **Production-Ready**
- ‚úÖ 63% test coverage (128 tests)
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ‚úÖ Schema migrations for upgrades
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling
- ‚úÖ Type-safe with comprehensive testing

---

## üìñ How It Works

### Setup (One-Time)

```bash
pip install claude-workshop
workshop init
```

This configures Claude Code to:
1. Load Workshop context at session start
2. Record knowledge automatically during conversations
3. Capture session summaries at session end

### Automatic Operation

Once set up, Workshop works invisibly in the background:

**Session Start** ‚Üí Claude loads project context from Workshop
**During Conversation** ‚Üí Claude records decisions/gotchas as you discuss them
**Session End** ‚Üí Workshop captures session summary automatically

### Manual Usage (Optional)

While Claude handles everything automatically, you can also:

```bash
# Query knowledge
workshop why "database choice"
workshop context
workshop recent

# Manually add entries
workshop decision "Using Redis for caching" -r "Need sub-millisecond latency"
workshop gotcha "API has 100 req/min rate limit"
workshop goal add "Implement retry logic"

# Import history
workshop import --execute
workshop import-status

# Manage entries
workshop search "authentication"
workshop delete <id>

# Admin
workshop info
workshop web  # Launch web UI
```

---

## üì• Importing Historical Sessions

One of Workshop's most powerful features: **import months of past conversations**.

### Basic Import

```bash
# Preview what would be imported (safe, read-only)
workshop import

# Actually import sessions
workshop import --execute

# Check import status
workshop import-status
```

### Advanced Import

```bash
# Import specific file
workshop import ~/.claude/projects/my-project/session.jsonl --execute

# Interactive review (approve each extraction)
workshop import --interactive --execute

# See detailed extraction preview
workshop import --verbose
```

### What Gets Imported

Workshop uses intelligent pattern matching to extract:

- **Decisions**: "We chose X because Y"
- **Gotchas**: "Watch out for...", "Important to note..."
- **Discoveries**: "Found that...", "Turns out..."
- **Summaries**: Complete session summaries from compactions
- **Preferences**: User coding style and preferences

Each extraction includes:
- Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- Source message UUID for traceability
- Timestamp for temporal context
- Automatic deduplication

### Import Intelligence

Workshop is smart about imports:
- ‚úÖ Tracks what's been imported (no duplicates)
- ‚úÖ Incremental imports (only new sessions)
- ‚úÖ Handles compaction summaries (months of context)
- ‚úÖ Filters noise (code snippets, JSON, hooks)
- ‚úÖ Validates content quality before storing

---

## üé® Example Workflows

### Starting a New Session
```bash
claude  # Start Claude Code

# Claude automatically loads Workshop context:
# "üìù Workshop Context Available
#  Recent decisions: Using PostgreSQL, Zustand for state
#  Active goals: Implement caching layer
#  Gotchas: API rate limit 100/min..."
```

### Querying Past Decisions
```
You: "Why did we choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB?"

Claude: *searches Workshop* "According to the decision recorded 2 weeks ago,
you chose PostgreSQL because you needed ACID guarantees for transactions and
complex relational queries. The reasoning was that MongoDB's eventual
consistency wasn't suitable for financial data."
```

### Bootstrapping a Project
```bash
# You've been working in Claude Code for months
# Install Workshop and import everything:

pip install claude-workshop
workshop init
workshop import --execute

# Workshop now has months of project knowledge
# Claude can answer questions about past decisions immediately
```

```

---

## üîß Configuration

Workshop uses `~/.workshop/config.json` for per-project settings:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "default_mode": "per-project",
  "projects": {
    "/Users/you/myproject": {
      "database": "/Users/you/myproject/.workshop/workshop.db",
      "jsonl_path": "~/.claude/projects/-Users-you-myproject",
      "auto_import": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Auto-configured on first use** - you typically don't need to edit this manually.

### Database Location

By default, Workshop stores data in `.workshop/workshop.db` at your project root.

You can customize per-project in the config, or use the optional web UI to manage settings.

---

## üåê Web UI (Optional)

Workshop includes an optional web interface:

```bash
workshop web
# Opens http://localhost:5001
```

Features:
- Browse all entries by type
- Full-text search
- Edit and delete entries
- View session summaries
- Manage configuration

Great for exploring Workshop's knowledge base visually!

---

## üîç JSONL File Locations

Workshop imports from Claude Code's JSONL session files:

**macOS/Linux:**
```
~/.claude/projects/<normalized-project-path>/
```

**Windows:**
```
%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\<normalized-project-path>\
```

**Path Normalization:**
- `/Users/name/project` ‚Üí `-Users-name-project`
- Underscores in project names are preserved

Workshop auto-detects the correct location. If import can't find files, it provides platform-specific troubleshooting.

---

## ü§ù Integration with Claude Code

Workshop provides three integration points:

### 1. Session Start Hook
Loads project context when Claude Code starts:
```bash
~/.claude/projects/myproject/workshop-session-start.sh
```

### 2. Session End Hook
Captures session summary when Claude Code exits:
```bash
~/.claude/projects/myproject/workshop-session-end.sh
```

### 3. Pre-Compact Hook
Preserves context before compaction:
```bash
~/.claude/pre-compact/workshop-pre-compact.sh
```

**All hooks are set up automatically by `workshop init`.**

---

## üìä Why the Test Coverage Matters

Workshop has **63% test coverage** with **128 tests** across:
- JSONL parsing and pattern extraction (95% coverage)
- SQLite storage operations (75% coverage)
- Configuration management (98% coverage)
- Display and formatting (27% coverage - mostly console I/O)

This isn't just for show‚Äîit means:
- ‚úÖ Reliable imports that won't corrupt your data
- ‚úÖ Safe schema migrations when upgrading
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across platforms
- ‚úÖ Confidence that Workshop won't lose your knowledge

**Production-ready means tested.**

---

## üìù Example Use Cases

### 1. **Architectural Decision Records**
```bash
# Claude automatically captures these during conversations
workshop why "microservices"

# Output:
# üí° DECISION (2 weeks ago)
# Using microservices architecture for backend
# Why: Need independent scaling of services, team prefers polyglot approach
```

### 2. **Onboarding New Team Members**
```bash
workshop context
workshop sessions --limit 10

# New devs can see entire project history:
# - What decisions were made and why
# - What gotchas to avoid
# - Current architecture and patterns
```

### 3. **Debugging Production Issues**
```bash
workshop search "authentication flow"

# Instantly find all discussions about auth:
# - Original implementation decisions
# - Known gotchas with OAuth
# - Recent changes to token handling
```

### 4. **Resuming After Time Away**
```bash
# After weeks off the project:
workshop recent
workshop context

# Claude: "Welcome back! Since your last session:
#  - Completed caching implementation
#  - Discovered rate limiting issue with API
#  - Next step: Add retry logic with exponential backoff"
```

---
