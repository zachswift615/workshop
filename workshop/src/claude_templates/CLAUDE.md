# Workshop CLI Integration

This project uses Workshop, a persistent context tool. At the start of each session, Workshop context is automatically loaded. At the end of each session, a summary is automatically saved.

## Workshop Commands

**Use Workshop liberally throughout the session to:**
- Record decisions: `workshop decision "<text>" -r "<reasoning>"`
- Document gotchas: `workshop gotcha "<text>" -t tag1 -t tag2`
- Add notes: `workshop note "<text>"`
- Track preferences: `workshop preference "<text>" --category code_style`
- Manage state: `workshop goal add "<text>"` and `workshop next "<text>"`

**Query context (use these frequently!):**
- `workshop why "<topic>"` - THE KILLER FEATURE! Answers "why did we do X?" - prioritizes decisions with reasoning
- `workshop context` - View session summary
- `workshop search "<query>"` - Find relevant entries
- `workshop recent` - Recent activity
- `workshop summary` - Activity overview
- `workshop sessions` - View past session history
- `workshop session last` - View details of the most recent session

**Important:** Workshop helps maintain continuity across sessions. Document architectural decisions, failed approaches, user preferences, and gotchas as you discover them.

**Best Practice:** When you wonder "why did we choose X?" or "why is this implemented this way?", run `workshop why "X"` first before asking the user!
