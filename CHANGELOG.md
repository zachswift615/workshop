# Changelog

All notable changes to Workshop will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.4] - 2025-01-04

### Improved
- **Search ranking**: Dramatically improved `workshop why` command to surface most relevant answers first
  - Keyword occurrence counting (not just presence)
  - Reasoning length boost for more complete explanations
  - Tag count boost for curated entries
  - "Why" indicator boost for entries with "provides", "enables", "better", etc.
  - BM25 ranking for better FTS5 relevance in regular search

### Fixed
- Fixed AttributeError when entries have null reasoning field in why_search

## [1.0.3] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- **Search query bug**: Fixed crash when searching for terms with hyphens (e.g., "auto-attachment"). FTS5 queries now properly handle special characters by normalizing hyphens to spaces.
- **Error display**: Search errors now show user-friendly messages instead of Python tracebacks
- **Session hook context**: Fixed truncated/empty context display in session start hook by using proper JSON escaping

### Added
- **Search filters**: Added `--type` option to filter search results by entry type (note/decision/gotcha/preference/goal/next)
- **Search formatting**: Added `--format` option for compact or full display of search results
- **Fallback search**: Implemented LIKE-based fallback search when FTS5 queries fail
- **Test coverage**: Added 4 comprehensive tests for special character search handling

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-04

### Added
- **Auto-cd to project root**: Workshop commands now automatically change to the project root (parent of `.workshop/`) when executed. This prevents Claude Code from creating nested `.workshop` directories when running commands from subdirectories.
- Test coverage for auto-cd feature (`test_changes_to_project_root`)

### Changed
- Implemented `_change_to_project_root()` helper function to ensure consistent workspace behavior across all CLI commands

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- **Web UI workspace bug**: Web UI now correctly shows data from the workspace where `workshop web` was launched. Previously, when running `workshop web` in one project and then switching to another project and running it again, the UI would show the first project's data instead of the current project's.
- CLI now explicitly passes `workspace_dir` to Flask app to ensure correct workspace binding
- Added warning message to web UI startup explaining workspace behavior

### Added
- Regression test for web UI workspace bug (`test_web_command_passes_workspace`)
